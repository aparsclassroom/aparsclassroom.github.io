                to the contents at any time, without advance notice. Neither the company nor any third parties give any

                flaws in the information and materials we're providing, and we make no promises about their accuracy.
            </li>
            <li>For our users, our website serves as a resource center for collated educational content and relevant
                sources. We take no duty for the accuracy, completeness, or use of such information, which is provided
                on a "as is" basis. We're not liable for ensuring the site's information is updated or accurate. Any
                inaccuracies in the information we assemble, which comes from third-party sources, or which is
                unavailable, would not be our responsibility. The site may also provide hyperlinks to other websites
                from time to time. The following links are provided for your information, so that you can find further

            <li>The materials and goods are based on concepts from the curriculum, which is outlined for pupils of
                various classes. The Application/Services/Products should not be seen as a replacement for traditional
                schooling; instead, they are designed to complement it by providing a way to make complex ideas easier
                to understand. Everything about the subject would remain the same, except the definitions and equations.
                The Company understands that there are other ways to present structured curriculum pedagogy and that the
                inclusion of methods in the Application/Services/Products does not mean that the company endorses any of
                them. The use of our Services/Website/Products does not guarantee entry to any academic institutions or
                the success of any exam or achieving any designated percentage in any test.</li>
            <li>Contents of the Application/Services/Website/Products (especially those about services which help with
                administrative tasks) are sometimes opinionated. Such opinions will not be the responsibility of the
                company. The company also provides no guarantees on the quality, content, or completeness of the
                information and data.</li>
            <li>The Services include interactive content, and we encourage users to submit content for publication. The
                content is subject to editing prior to publication. No accountability or obligation is accepted by the
                company for any content communicated via this method. The company maintains the right to remove, review,
                edit, or delete any content at its sole discretion. We will not be liable for any user-generated content
                placed on the site, whether or not we have approved any user-submitted answers. It would be
                irresponsible of us to make sure that the content provided by any User doesn't infringe on anyone's
                copyright.</li>
            <li>The Company (and its subsidiaries/affiliates) may contact Users through SMS, email, and phone calls to
                inform them about their services and products and to seek permission to demonstrate their offerings. The
                User grants permission to the Company (and its subsidiaries/affiliates) to contact him/her via
                telephone, SMS, e-mail, and he/she agrees to hold the Company harmless from any liability, including
                financial penalties, damages, and expenses if the User's mobile number is registered with the Do Not
                Call (DNC) database. You will be contacted through several means for marketing and educational
                information once you register, including over the phone, SMS, and email.</li>
            <li>The company may, at the user's consent, assist in a demonstration of its products at the requested
                location, but the user understands that they have not been misled by anyone in regard to the products'
                quality or other features, and that they relied solely on their own investigations, inspections, and
                evaluations.</li>
            <li>The Company may reach you by your registered mobile number, e-mail, or any other contact information you
                supply to help us better provide our services. The User agrees to receive communications and messages
                from the Company and the student via the Services, and may receive messages via the methods specified in
                the paragraph above. The Company can monitor User/student downloads and use of the
                Application/Services/Products and contents to talk with the User/student in order to improve and
                optimize usage of the Services. Students must agree to have their doubts about assignments cleared by
                the application's service, and the application must respond to any questions that students have about
                their coursework.</li>
            <li>Even while the company has made an attempt to train its sales and service employees to do quality
                control, it offers no warranties or assurances about the employees' ability to do so, and is not
                responsible for any malfeasance committed by any of its employees. Company invites User feedback on this
                matter, and reserves the right to act as it sees fit.</li>
            <li>Elements of the Services including counseling, case management, and so on may be subject to their own
                terms, conditions, and fair use policy. The company has the authority to set various service aspects'
                requirements based on its regulations. Because of this, subscriptions to the app or signing up for
                services does not mean that the user is entitled to all the company provides. It's up to the company to
                decide who gets access to particular services. Our Services may be extended, canceled, discontinued, or
                changed without notice.</li>
            <li>Devices/tablets/instruments/hardware with particular specifications are compatible with the Company's
                products and/or Services, including the Application and content. The Company is not required to deliver
                operational products and services for any tools that it doesn't accept or that are bought from a third
                party and that don't work with the Company's merchandise. The company is free to upgrade the
                table/device type as needed.</li>
            <li>The company will not be held liable for any loss or damage resulting from your use of our products and
                services, including loss of data or impact on processing speed.</li>
            <li>At the time of purchase, you must specify the address where the shipment should be delivered. All
                merchandise must be delivered to the address provided upon ordering, and it is prohibited to change the
                delivery address following purchase completion. You must notify us of any change in your mailing address
                in advance of your expected shipping date. If you have any errors in your name or address, your purchase
                may not be delivered.</li>
            <li>The shipping charges associated with the return of goods damaged at the time of delivery will be paid by
                the company. For any reason other than the reasons listed above, the User is responsible for arranging
                the return of the canceled product(s) and is responsible for the shipping charges. (b)Please do not
                accept any delivery that appears to have been tampered with, opened, or damaged. The Company's products
                must be returned in their original condition. Returns will not be accepted for items that show any wear
                or damage in any way. All requests for product returns must be made within 15 days of delivery. Note

            <li>In order to use the application and the services, you will need to register and maintain an account. You
                will be asked to provide your name, mobile number, email address, residential address, student class and
                school, as well as any other information that the Application deems necessary. To ensure that the
                account information you give is accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date, remember that you are solely
                responsible for doing so. You will be in charge of protecting the account information, as well as all
                activity that takes place on your account. To avoid account access problems, you will need to check out
                at the conclusion of each session and inform the company of any unwanted access. If we have cause to
                think that you've had a security breach or misuse of your account, we may ask you to change your
                password or suspend your account, and you may do so without incurring any liability to the company. Our
                company will not be responsible for any losses or damages you could incur due to your failure to comply
                with this section. You admit that Your capacity to use Your account depends on external variables, such
                as the reliability of your internet service provider and your internet network, and so the Company
                cannot guarantee that You will always be able to access the Application. The Company shall not be
                responsible to you for losses originating from your failure to log into your account and access the
                services provided by the Application at any time, in addition to the disclaimers specified in the Terms
                and Conditions.</li>
            <li>Those who are under the age of 18, are not in debt resolution, or similar are not eligible to register
                for Our products or Services. For those under 18, the usage of our products and services is subject to
                your legal guardian or parents agreeing to the terms of our contract. If a minor uses the
                Application/Website/Services, it is presumed that he/she has received the approval of his/her legal
                guardian or parents, and that the legal guardian or parents has granted permission for him/her to use
                the Application/Website/Services. The company is not liable for any problems arising out of misuse of
                our products or services, including use by a minor. You agree that you and your students are using
                correct and complete data when using the Application, and that parents/legal guardians have given their
                authorization for students to use the software (in case of minors). In case it is found that you are
                under the age of 18 (eighteen) years and your parent/legal guardian has not given their approval to use
                the products or services, the company retains the right to end your membership and/or deny you access to
                the products or services. You are aware that we do not have the duty to make sure you meet the above
                requirements. You must personally guarantee that you meet the necessary qualifications. All those who
                are under the age of 18 (eighteen) must obtain the permission of their parents or legal guardians before
                submitting personal or family information to the Application.</li>

                fees) incurred because of: (i) your use of and access to the Application/Website/Services; (ii) your
                violation of any of these Terms or any other policy of the Company; (iii) your violation of any
                third-party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right; or (iv) any

                obligation to defend and reimburse the injured party will exist even after the agreement.</li>
            <li>No liability will be accepted by the Company, its officers, directors, employees, partners, or agents on
                your behalf or on behalf of any third party for any special, incidental, indirect, consequential, or
                punitive damages in any way related to your use of the Application.</li>
            <li>If you break these terms, the company's reputation will be ruined and they will not be able to recover
                losses. In the event of a breach, the company would be able to get a court order to prevent it. The
                Company may still seek additional remedies regardless of whether it obtains this relief.</li>
            <li>In addition to any legal recourse that the company may pursue, you will be immediately suspended or
                terminated if you violate any portion of this clause. If such requirements arise, the Company may have
                to reveal Your Account Information. You know that breaking the terms of this agreement could also put
                you in trouble under local laws.</li>
            <li>The legal matters of this contract shall be determined in accordance with the laws of Bangladesh,
                regardless of conflicts of law. In addition, these terms will be resolved in the jurisdiction of the
                relevant courts in Dhaka, and you agree to accept their authority.</li>
