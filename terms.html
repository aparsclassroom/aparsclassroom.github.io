                flaws in the information and materials we're providing, and we make no promises about their accuracy.
            </li>
            <li>For our users, our website serves as a resource center for collated educational content and relevant
                sources. We take no duty for the accuracy, completeness, or use of such information, which is provided
                on a "as is" basis. We're not liable for ensuring the site's information is updated or accurate. Any
                inaccuracies in the information we assemble, which comes from third-party sources, or which is
                unavailable, would not be our responsibility. The site may also provide hyperlinks to other websites
                from time to time. The following links are provided for your information, so that you can find further
                details. We do not support the website by using these image(s). The website we link to is not our
                responsibility(s). A link to the site may not be created without the explicit written permission of the
                company.</li>
            <li>The materials and goods are based on concepts from the curriculum, which is outlined for pupils of
                various classes. The Application/Services/Products should not be seen as a replacement for traditional
                schooling; instead, they are designed to complement it by providing a way to make complex ideas easier
                to understand. Everything about the subject would remain the same, except the definitions and equations.
                The Company understands that there are other ways to present structured curriculum pedagogy and that the
                inclusion of methods in the Application/Services/Products does not mean that the company endorses any of
                them. The use of our Services/Website/Products does not guarantee entry to any academic institutions or
                the success of any exam or achieving any designated percentage in any test.</li>
            <li>Contents of the Application/Services/Website/Products (especially those about services which help with
                administrative tasks) are sometimes opinionated. Such opinions will not be the responsibility of the
                company. The company also provides no guarantees on the quality, content, or completeness of the
                information and data.</li>
            <li>The Services include interactive content, and we encourage users to submit content for publication. The
                content is subject to editing prior to publication. No accountability or obligation is accepted by the
                company for any content communicated via this method. The company maintains the right to remove, review,
                edit, or delete any content at its sole discretion. We will not be liable for any user-generated content
                placed on the site, whether or not we have approved any user-submitted answers. It would be
                irresponsible of us to make sure that the content provided by any User doesn't infringe on anyone's
                copyright.</li>
            <li>The Company (and its subsidiaries/affiliates) may contact Users through SMS, email, and phone calls to
                inform them about their services and products and to seek permission to demonstrate their offerings. The
                User grants permission to the Company (and its subsidiaries/affiliates) to contact him/her via
                telephone, SMS, e-mail, and he/she agrees to hold the Company harmless from any liability, including
                financial penalties, damages, and expenses if the User's mobile number is registered with the Do Not
                Call (DNC) database. You will be contacted through several means for marketing and educational
                information once you register, including over the phone, SMS, and email.</li>
            <li>The company may, at the user's consent, assist in a demonstration of its products at the requested
                location, but the user understands that they have not been misled by anyone in regard to the products'
                quality or other features, and that they relied solely on their own investigations, inspections, and
                evaluations.</li>
            <li>The Company may reach you by your registered mobile number, e-mail, or any other contact information you
                supply to help us better provide our services. The User agrees to receive communications and messages
                from the Company and the student via the Services, and may receive messages via the methods specified in
                the paragraph above. The Company can monitor User/student downloads and use of the
                Application/Services/Products and contents to talk with the User/student in order to improve and
                optimize usage of the Services. Students must agree to have their doubts about assignments cleared by
                the application's service, and the application must respond to any questions that students have about
                their coursework.</li>
            <li>Even while the company has made an attempt to train its sales and service employees to do quality
                control, it offers no warranties or assurances about the employees' ability to do so, and is not
                responsible for any malfeasance committed by any of its employees. Company invites User feedback on this
                matter, and reserves the right to act as it sees fit.</li>
            <li>Elements of the Services including counseling, case management, and so on may be subject to their own

                responsible for doing so. You will be in charge of protecting the account information, as well as all
